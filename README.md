# fungraphs

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of fungraphs is to provide a framework for graph-based change
point detection of function data. **Note that this is being updated and
should shortly join the more complete functional change point package,
fChange.** Find fChange on [GitHub](https://github.com/jrvanderdoes/fChange) while it is awaiting approval from CRAN.

## Installation

You can install the development version of fungraphs from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jrvanderdoes/fungraphs")
```
